<p>Toyota is known for their manufacturing process. People have <a href='http://amzn.to/fyFezV' title='Toyota Production System: Beyond Large Scale'>studied</a> and <a href='http://amzn.to/hdfRAv' title='Toyota Kata'>emulated</a> it for years. Recently <a href='http://www.poppendieck.com/' title='Mary and Tom Poppendieck Lean Software Development'>Mary and Tom Poppendieck</a> brought it to <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development' title='Lean Software Development'>software development</a>.</p>

<p>I assumed Toyota used their renowned manufacturing process to write the software for their vehicles. Henrik&#8217;s article proved me wrong.</p>

<p>My favorite quote from the article:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My conclusion after the trip was &#8220;well, now I know that there&#8217;s at least one company in the world that can succeed with the waterfall model&#8221; and I decided to stop bashing the waterfall model as hard as I usually do. Now, however, with all the problems Toyota are having, I&#8217;m starting to reconsider.</p>
